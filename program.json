      "abstract": "<p>The inner workings of {ggplot2} are difficult to grasp even for experienced\nusers because its internal object-oriented (ggproto) system is hidden from user-\nfacing functions, by design. This is exacerbated by the foreignness of ggproto\nitself, which remains the largest hurdle in the user-to-developer transition.\nHowever this needs not to be the case: ggplot internals have clear parallels to\ndata wrangling, where data is passed between methods that take inputs and return\noutputs. Capitalizing on this connection, package {ggtrace} exposes the familiar\nfunctional programming logic of ggplot with functions that inspect, capture, or\nmodify steps in a ggplot object's execution pipeline, enabling users to learn\nthe internals through trial-and-error.<\/p>\n<p>Talk materials are available at <a href=\"https://github.com/yjunechoe/ggtrace-rstudioconf2022\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/yjunechoe/ggtrace-rstudioconf2022<\/a>.",

By using bootstrap resampling, we can\ncreate many models that produce a prediction distribution – regardless of the\nmodel type!

However, package developers typically use an entirely separate set of more traditional development tools, and the context switching between these tools and notebooks can be frustrating. Not only do you lose the ability to iterate fast, but you lose the ability to document and test your code in-situ, requiring you to create documentation and tests separately from source code.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/fastai/nbdev\">Nbdev<\/a> is a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming\">literate programming framework<\/a> that allows you to develop Python libraries within Jupyter Notebooks.

Tplyr now let’s you dive\nin, and for any result provides the traceability of how that result was derived,\nand the data used to do-so. In our talk, we will explore this new functionality\nbuilt into Tplyr, the mechanics that make it work, and how these new features\nare useful in the clinical world and beyond.<\/p>\n",

It’s the largest dataset I’ve ever worked with.\nThe variety of sources and the quantity data can be overwhelming.

A ggplot of a full day of heart rate data\nprovided me (and my doctor) important context on two occasions when I went to\nthe ER.
