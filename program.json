      "abstract": "<p>The inner workings of {ggplot2} are difficult to grasp even for experienced\nusers because its internal object-oriented (ggproto) system is hidden from user-\nfacing functions, by design. This is exacerbated by the foreignness of ggproto\nitself, which remains the largest hurdle in the user-to-developer transition.\nHowever this needs not to be the case: ggplot internals have clear parallels to\ndata wrangling, where data is passed between methods that take inputs and return\noutputs. Capitalizing on this connection, package {ggtrace} exposes the familiar\nfunctional programming logic of ggplot with functions that inspect, capture, or\nmodify steps in a ggplot object's execution pipeline, enabling users to learn\nthe internals through trial-and-error.<\/p>\n<p>Talk materials are available at <a href=\"https://github.com/yjunechoe/ggtrace-rstudioconf2022\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/yjunechoe/ggtrace-rstudioconf2022<\/a>.",

However, I argue that creativity\nis an underrated skill that you can and should practice. In this talk, I want\nto tell you a story about a project I did to stretch my creative brain and use\nmy favorite tool, R. I designed a quilt in R using generative art ideas. Then\nI created individual blocks that make up the larger design. I used foundation\npaper piecing, a method that allows for intricate designs but has geometrical\nconstraints. I hope my talk will entertain and inspire folks to exercise their\ncreative muscles to improve their performance and enjoyment of their day jobs.<\/p>\n<p>Talk materials are available at <a href=\"https://github.com/awalsh17/quiltR\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/awalsh17/quiltR<\/a>.",

We focus on a workflow where (1) data are stored in multiple files\nthat can be hosted remotely (e.g., on S3-compatible storage), (2) queries are\nprocessed batchwise and in parallel allowing for efficient processing of bigger-\nthan-memory geospatial data and (3) results can be passed without copying to\nRust, Python, or other R packages for further analysis.<\/p>\n<p>Talk materials are available at <a href=\"https://github.com/rstudio/rstudio-conf/blob/master/2022/deweydunnington/Accelerating%20geospatial%20computing%20using%20Apache%20Arrow%20-%20Dewey%20Dunnington.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/rstudio/rstudio-conf/blob/master/2022/deweydunnington/Accelerating%20geospatial%20computing%20using%20Apache%20Arrow%20-%20Dewey%20Dunnington.pdf<\/a>.",

      "abstract": "<p>There are many benefits to using R and no lack of packages that help you solve technical difficulties, but you may still get stuck at selling it to decision-makers or implementing it at work. Tiger's recommendation is to start a project that focuses on automating work with R and gets everyone involved. Once the value of R has been established, selecting RStudio Workbench and RStudio Connect for streamlining tasks would not be a difficult choice.<\/p>\n<p>Several years ago, Tiger's organization moved away from SAS in favor of R for modeling projects, but there wasn’t much initiative taken company-wide to move everything to a new tool. To help change that, he started a work automation project using R that has saved 12K+ hours of manual work.<\/p>\n<p>In this talk, he will share the key parts of the project, lessons learned, and a structure you can follow if you would like to do something similar in your organization.<\/p>\n<p>Talk materials are available at <a href=\"https://tigertang.org/rst_conf_2022_talk/\" target=\"_blank\">https://tigertang.org/rst_conf_2022_talk/<\/a>.",

Not only do you lose the ability to iterate fast, but you lose the ability to document and test your code in-situ, requiring you to create documentation and tests separately from source code.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/fastai/nbdev\">Nbdev<\/a> is a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming\">literate programming framework<\/a> that allows you to develop Python libraries within Jupyter Notebooks.

At UKHSA I write in - and teach - R, SQL, Python,\nand other programming and computing skills. Although currently much of\nmy work is geared towards data engineering and infrastructure (for R,\ncomputing &amp; data platforms, and team building), my favourite part of\nwork is epidemiology analysis (in R!). I also work on R infrastructure\nfor &quot;Applied Epi&quot; (the team behind the &quot;Epidemiologists' R Handbook&quot;),\nas well as on some soon-to-be-announced open source projects on\nscaling and containerising R workloads.<\/p>\n"
