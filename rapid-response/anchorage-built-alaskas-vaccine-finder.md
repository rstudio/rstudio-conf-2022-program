<!-- ABSTRACT ----
Please write abstract below. You may use simple markdown (links, code style, bold, italics)
-->

In January 2021, Alaska residents seeking a COVID-19 vaccine appointment faced
a convoluted maze of websites. The software was made for providers—not for
residents.

The Anchorage Innovation Team built a fast, and mobile vaccine finder website
for Alaska using R. What started as a web scraping prototype launched statewide
one week later and ultimately connected tens of thousands of Alaskans to a
vaccine.

This talk will cover how we used R to build Alaska's vaccine finder. Including:

-Scraping and http packages (rvest &httr) -Using Heroku and S3 to run R jobs
24/7 -Creating a flexible data service with R

Ben Matheson is the Data Analyst for the Anchorage Innovation Team, a startup
inside city government in Anchorage, AK.
