<!-- ABSTRACT ----
Please write abstract below. You may use simple markdown (links, code style, bold, italics)
-->

The R7 package is a new OOP system designed to be a successor to S3 and S4. It
has been designed and implemented collaboratively by the RConsortium Object-
Oriented Programming Working Group, which includes representatives from R-Core,
BioConductor, RStudio/tidyverse, and the wider R community.

In this talk, I'll introduce R7 to the wider world. Attendees will learn why we
created R7 and how they can use it to create new classes and packages. I hope to
inspire folks to download, try it out, and give us the feedback we need to make
it better.
