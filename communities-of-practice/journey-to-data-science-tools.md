<!-- ABSTRACT ----
Please write abstract below. You may use simple markdown (links, code style, bold, italics)
-->

Data suggests that less than 3% of data scientists are women of color. My
journey and that of many other women who fall at the intersection of being
underrepresented in this field is one that is often filled with pitfalls and
curves that can result in continued exclusion in these spaces. My journey as a
historically excluded double minority in STEM is one of triumph, but not without
the community educational tools, online platforms and genuinely inclusive
members of the R Studio and open science communities. My work explores how we
can build on these tools and further propel the use of open science as a tool
for equity and diversity in STEM, now more than ever.
