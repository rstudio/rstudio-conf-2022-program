<!-- ABSTRACT ----
Please write abstract below. You may use simple markdown (links, code style, bold, italics)

When someone asks about essential skills for data careers, I often hear
responses like R, Python, and machine learning. However, I argue that creativity
is an underrated skill that you can and should practice. In this talk, I want
to tell you a story about a project I did to stretch my creative brain and use
my favorite tool, R. I designed a quilt in R using generative art ideas. Then
I created individual blocks that make up the larger design. I used foundation
paper piecing, a method that allows for intricate designs but has geometrical
constraints. I hope my talk will entertain and inspire folks to exercise their
creative muscles to improve their performance and enjoyment of their day jobs.
