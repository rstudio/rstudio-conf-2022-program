<!-- ABSTRACT ----
Please write abstract below. You may use simple markdown (links, code style, bold, italics)
-->

Statistics Canada is the official statistical agency of Canada and employs
over 6,000 employees. Statistics Canada has a legal obligation to ensure
that personal information collected for statistical purposes is kept strictly
confidential. An internal system which prevents the release of confidential
information is only implemented in SAS. As such, many Analysts and Data
Scientists at Statistics Canada must use the SAS programming language as part of
their workflow. It is therefore imperative to find ways to work with open source
programming languages and SAS seamlessly. I will present a method for achieving
a harmonious workflow between R, Python, and SAS, all within RStudio.
