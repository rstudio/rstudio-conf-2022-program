<!-- ABSTRACT ----

This talk discusses how we used R to solve some of the challenges we faced when
all classes were emergency onlined as a result of COVID. Instructors improvised
typically defaulting to zoom, and survey data showed that more than half of
our student population did not have access to a laptop or computer, but all
did have a smartphone. We set out to mitigate this by creating a mobile app
which facilitates a feedback-loop between students and instructors and provides
analytics of this interaction.Starting as a shiny-app with {shinymobile},
we applied linguistic and social network analysis to provide the instructor
with analyses. As the pandemic dragged on the system evolved and became more
integrated with google cloud and the Andoid ecosystem.
