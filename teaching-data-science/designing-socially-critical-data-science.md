  bio: |+
    Brian's career has spanned teaching, researching, and being a
    practicing software engineer. His Ph.D. in Computing Education
    Research focused on how engineering students learn software design.
    In subsequent post-doctoral research positions, his work expanded to
    educational games, ethnography of engineering practice, and teaching
    computational modeling and data science. He then developed enterprise
    level web apps for educational clients as well as personally
    developing and releasing Transcriptase, a free qualitative data
    analysis app available on both Windows and macOS. Outside of work,
    Brian enjoys improv, games of all kinds, and being inspired by others’
    favorite forms of geekery.

<!-- ABSTRACT ----
Please write abstract below. You may use simple markdown (links, code style, bold, italics)
-->

I'll discuss designing a socially-conscious and socially-critical data science
course. This talk will be interesting to anyone who designs or delivers
educational opportunities for young data scientists. The topic is important
because data science is not value neutral. Learners should understand how
data and data analyses can encode biases and assumptions. Particularly when
we collect data from or about people, we should ask who is privileged or
disadvantaged by how we gather and analyze that data? Attendees will learn
how I’ve come to design and teach data science courses that emphasize morality
and ethics. They’ll also learn how I design for inclusion and work to create
reflective learning environments.
