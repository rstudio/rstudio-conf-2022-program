<!-- ABSTRACT ----
Please write abstract below. You may use simple markdown (links, code style, bold, italics)
-->

It happens to us all - a request to update a workflow or data started before
your time. The materials left behind leave much to be desired; a few Word docs
here, a couple Excel workbooks there, some scattered ArcGIS maps, and PDFs.
But fear not! In this talk, we will cover how to complete a project intake
by evaluating current workflows, data sources, and methods. Then, we will
assess which tools to use, including packages like {groundhog}, {testthat},
and {rmarkdown} and version control with GitHub. We will cover code and file
hygiene, and how to maintain your motivation when obstacles appear. Finally, we
will explore strategies for making this legacy project your own and setting up
the next round of updates for success.
