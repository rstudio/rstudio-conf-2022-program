    Hezi is currently finishing his PhD in marine ecology at Tel Aviv
    University, where he also taught R to other graduate students.
    His research focuses on the impacts of invasive species on the
    Mediterranean Sea. He is in a constant pursuit of honing his data
    science skills, and always on a lookout for challenging obstacles that
    can be overcome with creative thinking.

<!-- ABSTRACT ----
Please write abstract below. You may use simple markdown (links, code style, bold, italics)
-->

The Belmaker lab fieldwork involves underwater surveys where we document the
observed marine species. Historically, Microsoftâ€™s Access was used for data
input. But as the number of surveyors increased, a new user-friendly platform
was needed to avoid bottlenecks. In this talk, I share my experience of
developing such a platform for the lab using tidyverse packages. This experience
demonstrates the concept of Minimum Viable Products as the use of Google Sheets
evolved from manually creating the sheets to a single line of code. We encourage
other researchers to expand their use of R to create a tailor made data
processing workflow - from the data input stage.
