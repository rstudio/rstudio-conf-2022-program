<!-- ABSTRACT ----
Please write abstract below. You may use simple markdown (links, code style, bold, italics)
-->

Imagine going into the office and all your daily, weekly, or monthly reports
that used to take you hours have been generated for your review; Imagine
internal customers no longer need to wait for your data department to pull data
or create data reports. With the RStudio, you probably know that is entirely
possible but not sure where to start if your team does not use R. Hope this
talk will give you some insights on how you can get it started. At CARFAX, we
switched our analysis tool from SAS to R a couple of years ago. I have initiated
an Automation project at CARFAX that saved over 6,200 work hours. In this talk,
I will talk about the project, the lessons learned, the sustainable workflow,
and what you may start doing today.
