<!-- ABSTRACT ----
Please write abstract below. You may use simple markdown (links, code style, bold, italics)
-->

Data Scientists have a unique position to drive change and efficiency within
organizations workflows. By simplifying workflows to its core expectations,
we can design with purpose. Process and software are harmonized to reduce
risk and streamline the overall system. At GSK, we are developing capabilities
and challenging traditional processes. We must do this while still meeting
regulatory compliance requirements that can be complicated by historical
inertia. I will talk about how my team is using this approach to develop R
packages in tandem with process changes that are leading to wins. Attendees of
my talk with leave with an understanding of how to do the same.
