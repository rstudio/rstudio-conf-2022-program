      "bio": "<p>Hadley Wickham is the Chief Scientist at RStudio, a member of the R Foundation, and Adjunct Professor at Stanford University and the University of Auckland. He builds tools (both computational and cognitive) to make data science easier, faster, and more fun. You may be familiar with his packages for data science (the tidyverse: including ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, purrr, and readr) and principled software development (roxygen2, testthat, devtools, pkgdown). Much of the material for the course is drawn from two of his existing books, Advanced R and R Packages, but the course also includes a lot of new material that will eventually become a book called “Tidy tools”.</p>\n"
