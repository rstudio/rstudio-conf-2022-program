  bio: |+
    Sigrid works at RStudio, where she writes about open-source deep
    learning, machine learning, and scientific-computation frameworks.
    Seeing how related technologies are increasingly becoming a part of
    our everyday lives - often, without us even knowing - she is deeply
    worried about political, societal, and ethical impacts of AI use.
    While she's completely aware that talking and writing about what is
    going on won't make the dangers go away, she still thinks that in
    a situation where everyone's thoughts and actions matter, raising
    attention and awareness is a useful thing to do.

<!-- ABSTRACT ----
Please write abstract below. You may use simple markdown (links, code style, bold, italics)

Machine learning models, applied in the real world, can have unanticipated,
harmful side effects. Recommended counter-measures include structured
documentation of models ("Model Cards for Model Reporting") and training data
used ("Data Sheets for Datasets").

In this talk, I'd like to propose a similar, multi-dimensional approach to
analyzing the "solution" as a whole - "solution" as in "tech solutionism", the
common term for technical "fixes" that have unintended, harmful consequences.

The idea here is that, by asking WHAT a solution is doing, WHO is providing
it and WHY, as well as WHERE and HOW it will be used, we should be able to
systematically assess whether we are, in fact, confronted with an instance of
tech solutionism.
