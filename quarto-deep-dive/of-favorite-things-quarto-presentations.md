  bio: |+
    Tracy Teal has been working with open source communities as a
    developer, instructor and project leader throughout her career.
    As a PhD student at Caltech and then as an Assistant Professor
    in bioinformatics at Michigan State University, she saw that the
    bottleneck to discovery was no longer data production, but the
    skills and perspective to work with data. She went on to co-found
    Data Carpentry to scale data training along with data production
    and then became Executive Director of The Carpentries, continuing to
    develop open curriculum and an inclusive instructor community. She
    is currently the Open Source Program Director at RStudio where she
    is passionate about supporting open source developers and expanding
    access to tools that help people use data to answer the questions that
    are important to them.

<!-- ABSTRACT ----
Please write abstract below. You may use simple markdown (links, code style, bold, italics)
-->

Quarto is the next generation of RMarkdown, and comes with a new presentation
format, revealjs. In this talk, I’ll show a few of my favorite things about
making interactive HTML presentations with Quarto. Along the way you’ll
learn about the visual editor, multiple columns, delivering an effective talk
with speaker notes and mode, making your presentations pop with transitions,
effective ways to incorporate code into your presentation, beautiful themes
(and how to match your corporate style guide), and sharing it as pdf and HTML.
I’ll finish off with a brief look at generating a powerpoint presentation from a
template.
