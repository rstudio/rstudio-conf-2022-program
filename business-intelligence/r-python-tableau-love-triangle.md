    James is a Product Manager for Cloud Integrations at RStudio, where
    he focuses on helping RStudio commercial products seemlessly integrate
    into cloud environments. He has a background in statistics and data
    science and finds any excuse he can to write R code and ride his bike,
    although usually not at the same time.
