  bio: |+
    David Keyes is the CEO and founder of R for the Rest of Us. Since
    2019, R for the Rest of Us has helped hundreds of people and dozens
    of organizations learn to use R. And in our consulting work, R for
    the Rest of Us has created visually appealing reports that effectively
    communicate results to technical audiences and lay people alike.
    Despite this success growing R for the Rest of Us over the last three
    and a half years, David does not have a business background. A PhD
    anthropologist, David has learned about starting a business through
    trial and error. Having distilled some of these lessons, David is
    excited to share them with others interested in using their R skills
    to start their own businesses.

<!-- ABSTRACT ----
Please write abstract below. You may use simple markdown (links, code style, bold, italics)
-->

Lots of people I meet want to start their own business. "I know how to use R,"
they figure, "so I should be able to go out on my own, find clients, and work
for myself."

The reality for many people is very different. They spend weeks on a business
plan, website, and social media strategy. Then they sit down at their desk,
waiting for the flood of clients. But the clients never come.

Since starting R for the Rest of Us in 2019, I've learned a lot of lessons along
the way about (and how *not*) to run a business using R. In this talk, I'll
share some of these lessons.

Whether you have dreams to start a huge business or want to freelance using R,
this talk will help you get started with the next chapter of your career.
