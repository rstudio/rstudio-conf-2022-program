<!-- ABSTRACT ----
Please write abstract below. You may use simple markdown (links, code style, bold, italics)
-->

How does a US federal agency collecting tens of millions of records across
30,000 sites in over 50 countries to analyze these data efficiently and
effectively? My team and I have developed not just multiple custom packages
for working with our large quarterly datasets to manage the US government’s
HIV/AIDS response, but also workflows and a R user community to improve
collaboration, efficiency, and transparency. We would like an opportunity to
share our experiences on developing workflows, packages, and an R community
that government agencies or those with resource limitations and lots of data to
analyze would benefit from.
