<!-- ABSTRACT ----
Please write abstract below. You may use simple markdown (links, code style, bold, italics)
-->

R is more than just a tool for data analysis– it can help streamline and
automate processes, including managing and monitoring data pipelines. This
presentation highlights how R Markdown, RStudio Connect, and R Shiny can be
utilized to automate data processing, error logging, and process monitoring. By
the end of the presentation, attendees will better understand: (1) how RStudio
Connect paired with R Markdown can be used to automate data processing, (2) that
packages such as blastula and loggit can be used within R Markdown documents
scheduled on RStudio Connect to email users when an error is encountered during
data processing and log those errors, and (3) that the resulting logs can be fed
to a Shiny app to enhance process monitoring.
