<!-- ABSTRACT ----
Please write abstract below. You may use simple markdown (links, code style, bold, italics)
-->

GitHub is so much more than just version control and collaboration - it
provides some powerful compute and storage resources that more R users should be
leveraging in their projects!

The nflverse open sports data project leans on GitHub to: import and clean
millions of rows of data, apply predictive models, provide a number of formats
for easy analysis, and automatically update data daily throughout the NFL
season. Best of all, automating and hosting this pipeline is 100% free!

In this talk, I'll take you behind the scenes and showcase how you can transform
ordinary R scripts by adding GitHub Actions, Releases, and R packages to
automate your projects and make data and analysis more accessible in the public
domain.
