    Isabel Zimmerman is a software engineer on the open source team at
    RStudio, where she works on building MLOps frameworks. When she's not
    geeking out over new data science techniques, she can be found hanging
    out with her dog or watching Marvel movies.

<!-- ABSTRACT ----
Please write abstract below. You may use simple markdown (links, code style, bold, italics)
-->

Data scientists have an intuition of what goes into training a machine learning
model, but building an MLOps strategy to deploy that model can sound daunting
for data science teams. Model services are not one-size-fits-all, so it is
imperative to know a range of tools available. One option, Vetiver, is a
framework for R and Python created to make model deployment feel like a natural
extension of a data scientistâ€™s skill set.

This talk offers a high-level overview of what MLOps options are available for
model operationalization, but also shows a practical example of an end-to-end
MLOps deployment of a model-aware REST API using Vetiver.
