<!-- ABSTRACT ----
Please write abstract below. You may use simple markdown (links, code style, bold, italics)
-->

tidymodels is extending support for survival analysis and censored is a new
parsnip extension package for survival models. It offers various types of
models: parametric models, semi-parametric models like the Cox model, and tree-
based models like decision trees, boosted trees, and random forests. They
all come with the consistent parsnip interface so that you can focus on the
modelling instead of details of the syntax. Happy modelling!
