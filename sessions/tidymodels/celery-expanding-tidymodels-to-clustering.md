<!-- ABSTRACT ----
Please write abstract below. You may use simple markdown (links, code style, bold, italics)
-->

My name is Emil Hvitfeldt and I have spend the better part of this year working
with Kelly Bodwin to write the celery package which brings clustering to the
tidymodels framework.

Said framework marked a leap forward for making machine learning methods more
accessible to a general audiences in R However, it is currently limited to the
realm of supervised learning.

This talk marks the grand introduction of celery, showing functionality and
workflows that immediately should feel familiar to a tidymodels user
