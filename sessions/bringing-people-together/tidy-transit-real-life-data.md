California Integrated Travel Project’s mission is to make transit across
California simpler and more affordable. As part of this, we created an open
source data warehouse to allow easy analysis of the travel data people often
interact with every day.

In this talk we’ll discuss two big challenges we faced:

Creating tidy representations of daily schedules and payments data across 200
transit agencies. Enabling people with a range of backgrounds (R, SQL, and
python) and experience to quickly analyze the data.

Tidy data allowed us to turn equal focus on agencies running a single bus, and
those serving entire metropolitan areas.
