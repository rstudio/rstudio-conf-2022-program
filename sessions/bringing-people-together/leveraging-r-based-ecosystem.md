How does a US federal agency analyze tens of millions of records across
30,000 sites in over 50 countries analyze these data efficiently and
effectively? Five years ago, our team ventured beyond the confines of (largely) 
Excel and towards leveraging R to be more efficient in our analysis and 
workflows since data is instrumental to the mission of ending the global HIV
epidemic. We have created our own 'pit of success', providing analysts the
infrastructure and support needed to ease the learning of and working with R in 
our specific context. We will be sharing our experiences in digging this 'pit 
of success' that organizations would benefit from.
