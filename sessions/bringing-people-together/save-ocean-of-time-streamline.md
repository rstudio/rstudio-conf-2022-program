<!-- ABSTRACT ----
Please write abstract below. You may use simple markdown (links, code style, bold, italics)
-->

My organization currently has over 250 oceanographic sensors deployed around
the coast of Nova Scotia, Canada. Together, these generate around 4 million
rows of data every year. I was shocked when I discovered my colleagues
manually compiled, formatted, and analyzed these data using hundreds of
Excel spreadsheets. This was highly time consuming, error prone, and lacked
traceability. To improve this workflow, I developed an R package that reduced
processing time by 95%. The package has since become integral to our data
pipeline, including quality control, analysis, visualization, and report
generation in RMarkdown. The resulting datasets have already proven invaluable
to industry leaders looking to invest in Nova Scotia’s coastal resources.
