  bio: |+
    Greg has contributed to RStudio's brand, print and web designs
    since 2012. His credits include rstudio.com, many hex stickers, and
    countless shirts and trade show booths. While he often claims to have
    ghostwritten Hadley Wickham's books, that is probably not true. Greg
    is currently working alongside the Shiny team on UI.

Shiny users can prototype an app in minutes, but... What if it also looked
better almost immediately? In this talk, we'll walk through a new look for
Shiny's UI, as well as some new functionality.
