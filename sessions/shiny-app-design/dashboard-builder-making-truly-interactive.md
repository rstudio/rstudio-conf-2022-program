<!-- ABSTRACT ----
Please write abstract below. You may use simple markdown (links, code style, bold, italics)
-->

_I would like to create (more) Shiny Dashboards, but..._
- _I don't know how_
- _I can't write R code_
- _it's too complex_
- _I don't have enough time (even though I know how to build them)_

If this sounds familiar, this talk is for you. We present our latest project, the **dashboard-builder** that allows users to create full Shiny dashboards without writing a single line of code. You can find a [demonstration video here](https://youtu.be/oOKJLMAkEiw)

This drag&drop dashboard-builder allows you to interactively create native Shiny dashboards. Lowering the entry barrier for new users starting their data-science journey. They can begin to visualize their datasets without prior knowledge of R. More experienced users can use the dashboard-builder to quickly sketch out their ideas and export them to act as a foundation for more complex dashboards.
