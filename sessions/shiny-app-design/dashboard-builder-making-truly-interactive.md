<!-- ABSTRACT ----
Please write abstract below. You may use simple markdown (links, code style, bold, italics)
-->

R-Shiny is a great way to visualize and communicate complex models, even to non-
tech users. However, after deployment, these dashboards are not customizable
and limited in their interactivity. That is why we are creating a drag&drop
dashboard builder that allows users with and especially without programming
experience to intuitively create complex dashboards. In my talk, I will show
how we can make R-Shiny apps truly customizable and interactive. And therefore,
allowing users and customers to create the dashboards they want, without having
to write a single line of code. An additional benefit of our approach is,
that it lowers the barrier for new users to start using R. They can begin to
visualize their datasets without deep knowledge of R
