<!-- ABSTRACT ----
Please write abstract below. You may use simple markdown (links, code style, bold, italics)
-->

A design system is a set of standards to manage design at scale by reducing
redundancy while creating a shared language and visual consistency across
different pages and channels. This talk will go into detail about the history
of design systems, what components to include when creating a design system, and
lastly various examples of implementation. By the end of the talk, you should
have the tools to create your own design system within Shiny/RMarkdown to be
used by yourself, your brand, or your company.
