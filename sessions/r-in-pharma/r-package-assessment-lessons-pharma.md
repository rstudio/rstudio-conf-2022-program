<!-- ABSTRACT ----
Please write abstract below. You may use simple markdown (links, code style, bold, italics)
-->

As R users, we make choices daily about what packages to use in our work.
After discovering a package that may suit our needs, we consider its qualities
and make a judgement about whether to invest in its use. Here at GSK, we are
currently forging a path to using R in regulatory settings, which involves
careful curation and assessment of R packages for use on clinical trials
data. While this exercise is formalized for those of us in pharma, attendees
will learn about how related principles can better inform decisions they make
their own workflows, regardless of industry or experience. They will take away
specific qualities that indicate trustworthiness, as well as the importance of
considering the ecosystem as a whole.
