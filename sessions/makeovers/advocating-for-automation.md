<!-- ABSTRACT ----
Please write abstract below. You may use simple markdown (links, code style, bold, italics)
-->

Increasing quantity and types of available data and the need for more advance analyses are outpacing current tools in environmental science. R allows us to efficiently manipulate and analyze complex data; however, taking the first leap from a current workflow to automation can be challenging. This talk will focus on how to advocate for automation in a team with diverse skillsets. We’ll start with examples of small changes that can be made using {officer} and {openxlsx} to meet your team members where they are by presenting results in a manner familiar to them; and finish by presenting a case study of how we used R to automate software from a regulatory agency.
