<!-- ABSTRACT ----
Please write abstract below. You may use simple markdown (links, code style, bold, italics)
-->

Increasing quantities and types of available data and the need for more advanced
analyses are outpacing current tools in environmental science. R allows us to
preform statistical analyses more efficiently, while {Rmarkdown} and {officer}
allows us to present the results in a familiar way. {Shiny} allows us to create
data dashboards quickly, affordably, and with the flexibility to adapt to a
project’s needs. Using {reticulate} with python and {dbplyr} with SQL built
databases we can expand our data science capabilities through collaboration.
I’ll give examples of how our team uses R alongside software from regulatory
agencies, {Shiny} to improve tools previously developed in Microsoft Access or
Excel, and python and SQL to supplement R.
