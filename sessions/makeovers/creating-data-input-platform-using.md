  bio: |+
    Hezi is currently finishing his PhD in marine ecology at Tel Aviv
    University, where he also taught R to other graduate students.
    His research focuses on the impacts of invasive species on the
    Mediterranean Sea. He is in a constant pursuit of honing his data
    science skills, and always on a lookout for challenging obstacles that
    can be overcome with creative thinking.

<!-- ABSTRACT ----
Please write abstract below. You may use simple markdown (links, code style, bold, italics)

The Belmaker lab fieldwork involves underwater surveys where we document the
observed marine species. Historically, Microsoft’s Access was used for data
input. But as the number of surveyors increased, a new user-friendly platform
was needed to avoid bottlenecks. In this talk, I share my experience of
developing such a platform for the lab using tidyverse packages. This experience
demonstrates the concept of Minimum Viable Products as the use of Google Sheets
evolved from manually creating the sheets to a single line of code. We encourage
other researchers to expand their use of R to create a tailor made data
processing workflow - from the data input stage.
