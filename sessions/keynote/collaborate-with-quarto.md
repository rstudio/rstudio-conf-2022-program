    Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel is Professor of the Practice at Duke University and
    Developer Educator at RStudio. Mine’s work focuses on innovation in
    statistics and data science pedagogy, with an emphasis on computing,
    reproducible research, student-centered learning, and open-source education
    as well as pedagogical approaches for enhancing retention of women and
    under-represented minorities in STEM. Mine works on integrating computation
    into the undergraduate statistics curriculum, using reproducible research
    methodologies and analysis of real and complex datasets. Mine works on the
    [OpenIntro project](http://openintrostat.github.io/openintro/), whose
    mission is to make educational products that are free, transparent, and
    lower barriers to education. As part of this project she co-authored four
    open-source introductory statistics textbooks. She is also the creator and
    maintainer of [datasciencebox.org](https://datasciencebox.org) and she
    teaches the popular [Statistics with R MOOC on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/statistics).

<!-- ABSTRACT ----
Please write abstract below. You may use simple markdown (links, code style, bold, italics)

What is Quarto? In this talk, in four acts, we will discuss how Quarto unifies and extends the R Markdown ecosystem. Through our work with NASA Openscapes, Duke University, and RStudio, we will share our experiences authoring, teaching, and collaborating with Quarto. Full of demos with Quarto in RStudio and Jupyter and weaving together narrative, R, and Python code, we will showcase features of Quarto that have enabled us to reimagine our reproducible workflows. This talk will help you get the most out of Quarto regardless of your background with R Markdown, the computing language(s) you use, and your tool of choice for authoring.
