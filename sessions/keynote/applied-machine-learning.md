<!-- ABSTRACT ----
Please write abstract below. You may use simple markdown (links, code style, bold, italics)
-->

The [tidymodels framework](https://www.tidymodels.org) is a collection of R
packages for modeling and machine learning using tidyverse principles. Whether
you are just starting out today or have years of experience with ML, tidymodels
offers a consistent, flexible framework for your work. In this talk, learn how
tidymodels has been designed to promote **effective**, **safe**, and
**ergonomic** modeling practice. We will discuss how to think about the steps of
building a model from beginning to end, how to fluently use different modeling
and feature engineering approaches, how to avoid common pitfalls of modeling
like overfitting and data leakage, and how to version and deploy reliable models
trained in R.
