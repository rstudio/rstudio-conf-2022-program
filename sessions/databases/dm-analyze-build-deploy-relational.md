<!-- ABSTRACT ----
Please write abstract below. You may use simple markdown (links, code style, bold, italics)
-->

dm bridges the gap in the data pipeline between standalone data frames and
relational databases. Implementing a "grammar of joined tables", it provides a
consistent set of verbs for consuming, creating, and deploying relational data
models. In this talk I present a short overview of how dm can help your data
analysis and ETL processes, and highlight recent developments.
