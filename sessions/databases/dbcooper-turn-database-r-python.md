<!-- ABSTRACT ----
Please write abstract below. You may use simple markdown (links, code style, bold, italics)

The first step of any data analysis is importing data, but for tables in a
database this can be a surprisingly challenging step that takes analysts out
of their workflow. The dbcooper package turns a database connection into a
collection of accessor functions, letting users take advantage of autocomplete
as they browse a database in the same ways they would engage with local tables.
I'll walk through how dbcooper can be used to build a database-specific package,
whether for an organization's internal use or to wrap a public data source. The
dbcooper package supports both R (built on top of dbplyr) and Python (built on
top of siuba), and in either language makes it easy and intuitive to extract
insights from a database.
