    Kelly Bodwin is an Assistant Professor of Statistics and Data
    Science and an RStudio Certified Instructor. She is passionate about
    developing R tools (especially choosing names for packages) and
    about creating innovative ways to teach computing to data scientists.
    Although her love for R is eternal and unwavering, she is currently
    begrudgingly allowing a little python into her heart.

<!-- ABSTRACT ----
Please write abstract below. You may use simple markdown (links, code style, bold, italics)
-->

The friendly competition between R and python has gifted us with two stellar
packages for workflow-style predictive modeling: tidymodels in R, and scikit-
learn in python. If you've ever wondered which one to use in classrooms and
trainings, I say: Â¿Porque no los dos? (Why not both?)

The first half of this talk will be focused on pedagogy and philosophy. I will
compare and contrast the infrastructures of the two packages, primarily in the
context of how they enforce or support conceptual understanding.

The second half will provide some practical insight and tips - and some helpful
R functions - for running a class in a "bilingual" way, where students choose
which language(s) to use on assignments.
