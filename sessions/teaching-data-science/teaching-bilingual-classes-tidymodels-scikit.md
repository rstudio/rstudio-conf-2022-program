<!-- ABSTRACT ----
Please write abstract below. You may use simple markdown (links, code style, bold, italics)

The friendly competition between R and python has gifted us with two stellar
packages for workflow-style predictive modeling: tidymodels in R, and scikit-
learn in python. When I had to choose between them for a Machine Learning 
Course, I said: ¿Porque no los dos? (Why not both?)

In this talk, I will share how the differences in structure and syntax 
between tidymodels and scikit-learn impacted student understanding. Can a
helper function hide an important decision about tuning parameters?  Can a
slight change in argument input influence the way we describe a model? The 
answer is a resounding, "¡Sí!" 

Don't despair, though, because I will also provide advice for avoiding 
pitfalls when switching between languages or implementations. Together, 
let's think about the power that programming choices has to shape the 
mental model of the user, and the ways that we can responsibly document
our modeling decisions to increase cross-language reproducibility.
