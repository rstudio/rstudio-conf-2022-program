<!-- ABSTRACT ----
Please write abstract below. You may use simple markdown (links, code style, bold, italics)
-->

Over the years, the R community has experienced an increase in the number,
diversity and domain background of users. However, incorporation of R in the
field of Robotics is still not fully exploited even though the actuation of
manipulators such as robotic arms is based on streams of input data gathered
from sensors. With R constantly evolving and redefining how to turn data into
actionable insights, any domain that produces data now has the potential to use
R. What if this actionable insight means actuating a robotic arm? The aim of
this talk is to connect two previously separated worlds: robotic application
development and the data manipulation capabilities of R by demonstrating how to
actuate a Robotic arm using R and Arduino.
