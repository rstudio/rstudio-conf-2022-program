    Eric is an Early Career Researcher who continually seeks to tackle
    real-world challenges using applied research, data analytics and
    machine learning; all wrapped in unbridled empathy and enthusiasm. He
    is currently a Researcher/Data Scientist at the Leeds Institute for
    Data Analytics (LIDA) in the University of Leeds. He has also done
    research in robotics, computer vision and speech processing in Japan
    and Kenya, aimed at creating safe working environments and exploring
    human-robot interaction in board games. Eric is a co-founder and co-
    organizer of DekutR data science club at Dedan Kimathi University of
    Technology, Kenya. He plays the guitar (terribly but passionately).

<!-- ABSTRACT ----
Please write abstract below. You may use simple markdown (links, code style, bold, italics)

Over the years, the R community has experienced an increase in the number,
diversity and domain background of users. However, incorporation of R in the
field of Robotics is still not fully exploited even though the actuation of
manipulators such as robotic arms is based on streams of input data gathered
from sensors. With R constantly evolving and redefining how to turn data into
actionable insights, any domain that produces data now has the potential to use
R. What if this actionable insight means actuating a robotic arm? The aim of
this talk is to connect two previously separated worlds: robotic application
development and the data manipulation capabilities of R by demonstrating how to
actuate a Robotic arm using R and Arduino.
