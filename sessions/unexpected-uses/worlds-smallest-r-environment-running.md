<!-- ABSTRACT ----
Please write abstract below. You may use simple markdown (links, code style, bold, italics)
-->

Is it possible to do meaningful work in R on a $35 computer? How about a $15
computer? And what does that mean for education, data science, and computing
on small devices? In this talk, Mark introduces the R4Pi.org project, its
background and why on earth you'd even want to run R at the opposite end of
"scale" from everyone else.
