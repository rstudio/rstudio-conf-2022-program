  bio: |+
    John Goldin spent his career as a data analyst for the Yale University
    administration. He was the Director of Institutional Research for over
    20 years until retirement in 2011. Since then he has maintained some
    involvement with his old office, although each year he becomes more
    thoroughly retired. Even in retirement he finds plenty of data just
    begging to be analyzed. He was a teaching assistant for Lee Wilkinson
    (the author of The Grammar of Graphics) back in the 1970’s when they
    were both graduate students in Psychology at Yale.

<!-- ABSTRACT ----

After a visit to the ER, I discovered an ocean of personal data: more than 3
million rows of data about one of my favorite subjects: me. My watch averages
almost 5,000 measurements a day. That experience led me to explore the Apple
Health Export in more detail. It’s the largest dataset I’ve ever worked with.
The variety of sources and the quantity data can be overwhelming. I will
describe the basic measurements that are available and some of the things
one needs to be on the lookout for. A ggplot of a full day of heart rate data
provided me (and my doctor) important context on two occasions when I went to
the ER. Fortunately there’s no great medical drama involved, but the plots are
pretty neat and actually turned out to be helpful.
