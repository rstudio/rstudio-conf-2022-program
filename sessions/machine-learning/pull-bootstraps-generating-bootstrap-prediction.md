    I am the senior consumer experience (CX) analyst at Memorial Hermann
    Health System where I use R and tidymodels to provide actionable
    insights from patient satisfaction survey data. I love making
    beautiful charts, working on home improvement projects, and playing
    jazzy piano. I live in Houston, TX, with my fiancé and two obnoxious
    yet lovable pets.

<!-- ABSTRACT ----
Please write abstract below. You may use simple markdown (links, code style, bold, italics)

Sometimes, we want a model that generates a range of possible outcomes around
each prediction. Other times, we just care about point predictions and may
opt to use a fancy model like XGBoost. But what if we want the best of both
worlds: getting a range of predictions while still using a fancy model? That’s
where bootstrapping comes to the rescue! By using bootstrap resampling, we can
create many models that produce a prediction distribution – regardless of the
model type! In this talk, I’ll give an overview of bootstrap resampling for
prediction, the pros/cons of this method, and how to implement it as a part of a
tidymodel workflow with the workboots package.
