<!-- ABSTRACT ----

Society benefits when leaders make more evidence-based decisions, but growing
privacy concerns hamper researchers’ ability to understand and improve the
world. Fully synthetic data, pseudo data generated by models, can protect
confidentiality and produce statistically valid analysis. This talk shares how
the Urban Institute collaborates with the IRS to create fully synthetic tax data
for tax policy research. We built an R package called tidysynthesis to create
machine learning models for each variable in the data. tidysynthesis leverages
the power of tidymodels and allows users to run a sequences of machine learning
models with different recipes, engines, and samplers while adding additional
noise and enforcing logical constraints.
