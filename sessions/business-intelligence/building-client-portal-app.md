<!-- ABSTRACT ----
Please write abstract below. You may use simple markdown (links, code style, bold, italics)
-->

With the Dutch Mortgage Portfolio Management Group we built a client portal for
their customers wanting insights into their mortgage investment portfolio. This
was done with a Shiny app that runs in Azure App Service, with plumber api's
serving portfolio reports, and embedded power bi reports with clear and easy to
maintain dashboards.

Last year we saw a lot of great content on how to combine Tableau with Rstudio
Connect, in this talk we have answers for the Power BI users. An interesting
example of combining self-service BI with serious data science.

When Microsoft itselfs mentions 'we did not know how to do this', you know
you have an interesting topic for Rstudio Conf. https://www.youtube.com/watch?
