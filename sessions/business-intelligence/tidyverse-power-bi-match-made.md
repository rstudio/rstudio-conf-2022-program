<!-- ABSTRACT ----
Please write abstract below. You may use simple markdown (links, code style, bold, italics)
-->

Power BI is a multi-faceted business intelligence tool with built-in data
ingestion, transformation, and visualization features. The learning curve
for Power BI can be steep for many, but fortunately, R users can shorten the
learning curve by leveraging the Tidyverse. In this talk, attendees will get
introduced to how the Tidyverse can shorten the Power BI learning curve and
enable them to perform tasks in Power BI that are not possible using its native
functionality.
