    Anubhuti Mishra is a Senior Data Scientist who works at the
    intersection of public health and data science. In recent past she has
    developed indices to estimate subnational vulnerability to COVID-19 in
    Africa, built models to identify high-risk HIV patients, and created
    allocation vaccine allocation models. She really enjoys working low
    resource, high impact data environments.

<!-- ABSTRACT ----
Please write abstract below. You may use simple markdown (links, code style, bold, italics)

In 2022, African countries need to vaccinate most of their population against
COVID-19. With an influx of millions of doses, countries need to plan in near
real-time, considering constraints at every step of the supply chain. Our
Shiny app provides a low-cost decision-making tool for the Ministry of Health
in Côté d’Ivoire. Using lpSolve library, we optimize for factors like eligible
population in catchment area of vaccination sites, types and number of vaccine
doses, expiration date of vaccine does, availability of trained healthcare
staff, and presence of cold storage facility. The app maximizes number of people
vaccinated while minimizing vaccine wastage across thousands of vaccination
sites. (App development will end on May 31)
