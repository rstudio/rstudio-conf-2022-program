<!-- ABSTRACT ----
Please write abstract below. You may use simple markdown (links, code style, bold, italics)
-->

The California Department of Public Health’s (CDPH) COVID-19 response has
required processing and communicating large amounts of data with quick
turnaround times to inform strategic resource deployment in the state.
To achieve this goal, the COVID-19 Data Processing and Informatics Section developed an integrated workflow 
that includes a combination of tools: Microsoft Azure DevOps, RStudio Workbench, and RStudio
Connect. Attendees will walk away with an understanding of how these three tools helped 
our team prioritize, collaborate, decrease turnaround time, and scale our efforts 
to deploy and automate mission critical procedures and products.
