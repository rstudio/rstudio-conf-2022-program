<!-- ABSTRACT ----
Please write abstract below. You may use simple markdown (links, code style, bold, italics)
-->

The California Department of Public Health’s (CDPH) COVID-19 response has
required processing and communicating large amounts of data with quick
turnaround times to inform strategic resource deployment in the state.
To achieve this goal, we developed an integrated workflow that includes a
combination of tools: Microsoft Azure DevOps, RStudio IDE Server, and RStudio
Connect. Attendees will walk away with an understanding of the philosophy and
tools of Azure DevOps, how a git workflow works within RStudio to connect to
Azure DevOps, and how our team at CDPH leveraged all three products to deploy
and automate mission critical procedures or products.
