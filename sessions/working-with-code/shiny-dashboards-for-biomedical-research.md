<!-- ABSTRACT ----
Please write abstract below. You may use simple markdown (links, code style, bold, italics)
-->

As a senior policy analyst at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Diseases at the National Institutes of Health, I am part of a diverse team
that includes data analysts, scientists, and statisticians. Our goal is to help
NIAID leadership gain insight from large amounts of data. In this talk I will
discuss how my colleagues and I have used R Shiny to simplify business processes
and promote data driven decision making. In light of the recent pandemic, and
the ongoing threat of emerging infectious diseases, the ability to understand
a complex research portfolio is increasingly important. I will highlight how
we have used R Shiny to streamline workflows, enhance collaboration, and gain
insight into these large complex datasets.
