It can be daunting to start using R when no one else in your office is!
Using a case study from an administrative higher education office, learn how
you can begin to build your own R ecosystem, step by step, to increase the
efficiency and impact of your work, even as a solo contributor. Start from
scratch and get small wins by replacing common Excel tasks with reproducible
code, and then continue to develop iteratively, incorporating more of R’s
capabilities into your workflow until you’re humming along with internal
packages and parameterized reporting. We’ll discuss how R can ease the burden
of documentation and how to handle common challenges like when you can’t control
how you get your data or in which tool it is ultimately presented.
