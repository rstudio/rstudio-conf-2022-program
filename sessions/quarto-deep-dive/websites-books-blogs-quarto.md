<!-- ABSTRACT ----
Please write abstract below. You may use simple markdown (links, code style, bold, italics)
-->

A number of packages have emerged in the R ecosystem to help create websites
(hugodown), books (bookdown), and blogs (blogdown). In this talk, I'll show
you how Quarto handles creating these types of content and more. Whether you're
a grad student considering your first blog post about R, or a python expert
about to write a technical book, I'll show you how Quarto enables you to focus
on content while it takes care of the rest. In addition, I'll show the RStudio
team is making it as easy as possible to publish and share content within your
organization and to the whole community.
