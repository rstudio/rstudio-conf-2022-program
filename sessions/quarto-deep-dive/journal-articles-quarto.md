<!-- ABSTRACT ----
Please write abstract below. You may use simple markdown (links, code style, bold, italics)
-->

Quarto is the next generation version of R Markdown which allows users to
author executable documents that combine code with scientific markdown. Quarto
format extensions make it possible to customize the output produced by Quarto,
providing customized LaTeX or HTML and nearly any other configuration option in
Quarto. In my presentation, I will teach users how to

- Find existing format extensions - Install format extensions - Use existing
format extensions to create multi-format journal articles with production ready
HTML and LaTeX output - Create a format extension that includes customized
behavior and formatting

At the end of the presentation, users will be equipped with the knowledge
required to produce high quality academic documents.
