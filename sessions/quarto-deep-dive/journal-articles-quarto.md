Jupyter Notebooks play a critical role in in the workflow of many users. Notebooks are used to document existing code, to quickly prototype and iterate on ideas, and as a medium of technical communication. However, package developers typically use an entirely separate set of more traditional development tools, and the context switching between these tools and notebooks can be frustrating. Not only do you lose the ability to iterate fast, but you lose the ability to document and test your code in-situ, requiring you to create documentation and tests separately from source code.  

[Nbdev](https://github.com/fastai/nbdev) is a [literate programming framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming) that allows you to develop Python libraries within Jupyter Notebooks. In this talk, Hamel will describe the integration between Nbdev amd Quarto, which enables library developers to author their documentation right alongside their code, and automatically produce a Quarto website for their package. The result is a seamless workflow for developing, documenting, and testing software packages all within Jupyter Notebooks, with no context-switching required.
