<!-- ABSTRACT ----
Please write abstract below. You may use simple markdown (links, code style, bold, italics)
-->

Internal packages are great for boosting productivity and promoting good
practice, but what kinds of challenges do we face when designing solutions
for multi-lingual teams? Here I will advocate for a design approach we are
using at Bumble to build Python and R packages with the same foundations. 
I will discuss the benefits of this approach for the developer and the 
wider organisation.
