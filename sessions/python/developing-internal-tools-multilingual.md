<!-- ABSTRACT ----
Please write abstract below. You may use simple markdown (links, code style, bold, italics)

Internal packages are great for boosting productivity and promoting good
practice, but what kinds of challenges do we face when designing solutions
for multi-lingual teams? Here I will advocate for a design approach we are
using at Bumble to build Python and R packages with the same foundations. 
I will discuss the benefits of this approach for the developer and the 
wider organisation.
