<!-- ABSTRACT ----
Please write abstract below. You may use simple markdown (links, code style, bold, italics)
-->

Current customer demos don't reflect the breadth of Python workflows that a
user can develop through RStudio Workbench and deploy in Connect. This talk is
aimed at showcasing a Python data science workflow in production using RStudio
Professional products, demonstrating the entire life cycle- from automated
data preparation and model training, to deploying and monitoring the model. The
intended audience is 1) Python teams in an organization that already use RStudio
products, or 2) Python teams that are evaluating a solution that addresses
scaling, collaboration, and deployment.
