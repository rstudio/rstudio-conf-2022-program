<!-- ABSTRACT ----
Please write abstract below. You may use simple markdown (links, code style, bold, italics)

Internal packages are great for boosting productivity and promoting good
practice, but what kinds of challenges do we face when designing solutions
for multi-lingual teams? Here I will advocate for a design approach we are
using at Bumble to build Python and R packages with objects and functions that
are directly comparable. I will discuss the benefits of this approach for the
developer and the wider organisation, and how guiding principles like the Zen of
Python and the Tidyverse style guide have helped us along the way.
