Shiny for Python has the ability to be deployed without a server that runs Python. These applications can be served by any web hosting service. They are easily deployed and can scale to handle large amounts of traffic.

This mode of deployment is called **Shinylive**. It works by running Python in the userâ€™s web browser, using Pyodide, which is a version of Python that is compiled to WebAssembly. Shinylive opens up new possibilities for how Shiny applications can be used. In this talk I discuss the advantages and the limitations of Shinylive applications.
