<!-- ABSTRACT ----
Please write abstract below. You may use simple markdown (links, code style, bold, italics)
-->

In this presentation, I will share my experiences at the intersection of the
R and Kaggle communities. As Kaggle's first Notebooks Grandmaster, I will talk
about how R users can contribute and thrive in an increasingly Python dominated
community. A strong focus will be on the art of building insightful and engaging
Kaggle notebooks and exploratory data analyses in general. I will share my
lessons from running a weekly series aimed at promoting underrated Kaggle
notebooks and their authors. And I will talk about organising a Kaggle insights
competition aimed at exploring this dataset of 100 episodes, and what it taught
me about community dynamics, different approaches to exploratory challenges, and
the creativity of the participants.
