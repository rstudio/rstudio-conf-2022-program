<!-- ABSTRACT ----
Please write abstract below. You may use simple markdown (links, code style, bold, italics)

In community conversations at the Data Science Hangout, we’ve talked about
misalignment between what recruiters are looking for and who is actually a great
fit for a role. At one point, people started sharing their own degrees in the
chat: sociology, political science, finance, psychology, no degree, etc.

What makes us good at our jobs is so much more than the degree that we have.

I’m not a data scientist. When I think about my own role though, much of my
intuition comes from growing up in a restaurant and watching my mom create a
community among customers.

This talk will share a few community building tips to get you started and
perhaps a little inspiration to consider the other skills that qualify you for
what you want to do.
