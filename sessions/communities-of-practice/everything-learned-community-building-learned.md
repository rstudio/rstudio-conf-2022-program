<!-- ABSTRACT ----
Please write abstract below. You may use simple markdown (links, code style, bold, italics)
-->

In community conversations at the Data Science Hangout, we’ve talked about
misalignment between what recruiters are looking for and who is actually a great
fit for a role. At one point, people started sharing their own degrees in the
chat: sociology, political science, finance, psychology, no degree, etc.

What makes us good at our jobs is so much more than the degree that we have.

I’m not a data scientist. When I think about my own role though, much of my
intuition comes from growing up in a restaurant and watching my mom create a
community among customers.

This talk will share a few community building tips to get you started and
perhaps a little inspiration to consider the other skills that qualify you for
what you want to do.
