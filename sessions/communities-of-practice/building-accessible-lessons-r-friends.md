<!-- ABSTRACT ----
Please write abstract below. You may use simple markdown (links, code style, bold, italics)
-->

The Carpentries is a global community of volunteers who collaboratively develop
and deliver lessons to build capacity in data and coding skills to researchers
worldwide. In the recent redesign of our lesson infrastructure (serving >100
lessons, used daily by >5K learners), we replaced embedded Jekyll templates
with a workbench of modular and accessible packages using R and Pandoc. By
leveraging renv and knitr for R-based lessons, we provide a seamless and
collaborative lesson development experience that maximizes reproducibility and
minimizes frustration so authors can focus on the contents, not the tooling.
We demonstrate how anyone can use our infrastructure to build customised and
accessible sites for their own lessons or tutorials.
