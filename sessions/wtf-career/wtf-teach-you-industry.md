  bio: |+
    As academic faculty, I led cancer-focused research teams in the
    application and development of tools for applied machine learning,
    causal inference, and biostatistics. In the post-academic setting,
    I direct data science efforts in the oncology clinical trials space.
    I am a 13+ year R enthusiast, and an advocate for productive remote
    working environments (I live and work in an RV). My favorite activity
    is helping other data scientists become successful.

This talk presents a gathering of resources from the RStudio community for
industry job-seekers who are transitioning from academia. Examples include
packages for resume-building and cover letter writing, quick starts for personal
websites and GitHub profiles, and helpful R networks. A new website named after
the talk (wtf-aita.com) will showcase and link to the discussed resources, and
is open to further community contributions.
