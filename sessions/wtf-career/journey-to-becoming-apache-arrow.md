<!-- ABSTRACT ----
Please write abstract below. You may use simple markdown (links, code style, bold, italics)

Getting involved in open source is an amazing learning experience and helps
you grow your skills as a developer, but to a new contributor there are so
many unknown factors about open source projects. In this talk, I'm going to
discuss my journey from occasional open source contributor to full time project
maintainer, and answer questions such as: what does it look like from the inside
of an open-source project? What's a good way to get involved, and really learn
the internals of an R package? What does a full-time open source maintainer
spend their time doing? How can I navigate the social dynamics of an open source
project? How do contributions look entirely different from the point of view of
a contributor versus a maintainer?
