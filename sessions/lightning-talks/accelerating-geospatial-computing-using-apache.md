<!-- ABSTRACT ----
Please write abstract below. You may use simple markdown (links, code style, bold, italics)
-->

The ‘arrow’ R package and wider Apache Arrow ecosystem provide an end-to-
end solution for querying and computing on in-memory and bigger-than-memory
data sets using the Apache Arrow C++ library. In this talk we introduce the
‘geoarrow’ package, which extends Arrow to provide efficient columnar storage
for spatial types and functions to support spatial queries in the Arrow compute
engine. We focus on a workflow where (1) data are stored in multiple files
that can be hosted remotely (e.g., on S3-compatible storage), (2) queries are
processed batchwise and in parallel allowing for efficient processing of bigger-
than-memory geospatial data and (3) results can be passed without copying to
Rust, Python, or other R packages for further analysis.
