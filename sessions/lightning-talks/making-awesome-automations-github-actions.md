<!-- ABSTRACT ----
Please write abstract below. You may use simple markdown (links, code style, bold, italics)

This talk is an introduction to GitHub Actions (GHA), which is a feature 
from GitHub that allows us to automate several tasks in R. In this
presentation, I aim to answer these questions: "What is GitHub Actions?
How can I run R Scripts with it?". I will list supplementary materials that
are helpful to learn how to start automating tasks in R projects and packages.
