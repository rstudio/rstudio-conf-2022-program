    works in human-computer interaction and information visualization,
    including uncertainty visualization and the design of human-
    centered tools for data analysis. He co-directs the [Midwest
    Uncertainty Collective](http://mucollective.co) and is the author
    of the [tidybayes](https://mjskay.github.io/tidybayes/) and [ggdist]

<!-- ABSTRACT ----
Please write abstract below. You may use simple markdown (links, code style, bold, italics)

I propose a talk on visualizing distributions and uncertainty using {ggdist}.
I will describe how to think systematically about distributional visualization
as mappings of PDFs, CDFs, and quantile functions onto aesthetics, and how
support for this enables creative and easy exploration of the space of possible
uncertainty visualizations. I will highlight features like true gradient support
in R 4.1, support for distribution vector datatypes, and the automatic binwidth-
selecting geom_dots(). I expect to leave the audience with: (1) a systemic
way to think about visualizing distributions and uncertainty in the grammar of
graphics and (2) an understanding of how to actually do it using ggdist.
