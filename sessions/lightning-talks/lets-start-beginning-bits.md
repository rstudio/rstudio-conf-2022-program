    Alex Farach is an Analytics Manager and Data Scientist in the Applied
    Intelligence Discovery Lab at Accenture Federal Services (AFS) where
    he helps clients build productive relationships with their data.
    Prior to joining AFS as a data scientist in 2019 Alex worked as an
    economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Although his background
    is in statistics and economics, Alexâ€™s interests are varied. Since
    2014 he has been using R to solve problems across these interests,
    from creating art for personal music projects to developing machine
    learning solutions at large government agencies. Alex loves text
    analysis, making beautiful charts, and helping others learn data
    science.

<!-- ABSTRACT ----
Please write abstract below. You may use simple markdown (links, code style, bold, italics)
-->

The background section will give attendees a broad overview of the encoding and
decoding process in the human-to-computer loop, explain how bits are used, and
the math that gets us to common bit values.

In the ACII, Latin1, and Unicode section I will give a history on each one of
these 3 protocols and why the evolution was necessary.

In the Character String Encoding in R section I will explain how bits to
character encoding in R works. I will also highlight the differences between R
on linux/macOS and Windows.

The last part of my talk show how character encoding is approached in the
Tidyverse.

The talk will be presented in an intuitive way so that attendees can build the
necessary narrative to make the information sticky and valuable.
