<!-- ABSTRACT ----
Please write abstract below. You may use simple markdown (links, code style, bold, italics)
-->

Attendees will recieve a broad overview of the encoding and decoding process 
in the human-to-computer loop, how bits are used, and the math that gets us 
to common bit values. A brief history of ASCII, Latin-1, and UTF-8 will be 
provided as well.

Attendees will also be exposed to how character encoding works in R and in
the tidyverse.
