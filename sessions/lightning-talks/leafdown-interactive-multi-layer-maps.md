Interactive maps are indispensable tools for exploring spatial datasets 
because of their real-world context and intuitiveness. For a comprehensive 
understanding of the data, it is often necessary to switch between 
several map layers (such as states and counties) and to analyze multiple 
variables simultaneously - both of which are challenging. In this talk, 
I will show how we can overcome these challenges using the 
leafdown package, which allows us to create multi-layer maps embedded 
in Shiny apps.
