<!-- ABSTRACT ----
Please write abstract below. You may use simple markdown (links, code style, bold, italics)
-->

If you've ever tried to run a workshop using R, you'll be aware of the
challenges of getting everyone's laptop set up to able to run your R scripts,
Rmarkdown documents, or Jupyter Notebooks without errors.

What if you could host a workshop using R that required no setup from the
participants at all? With GitHub Codespaces, a GitHub repository becomes a
cloud-based engine for running R in a container with a single click. Every
participant, regardless of the power, configuration or operating system of their
laptop will have the same experience, all with NO setup in advance.

In this talk, I'll describe the process and share tips for setting up a GitHub
repository for an R-based workshop to take advantage of GitHub Codespaces.
