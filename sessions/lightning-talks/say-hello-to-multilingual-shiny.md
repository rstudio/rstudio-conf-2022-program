<!-- ABSTRACT ----
Please write abstract below. You may use simple markdown (links, code style, bold, italics)
-->

Multilingual shiny apps are not straightforward to build. Translation affects
almost every single aspect of an app. Although there are a few packages designed
to automate the translation process, they tend to only work for the most widely
spoken languages.

Using a bilingual English-Welsh shiny app we developed to present public health
data as a case study, this talk will discuss:

- how we built a multilingual shiny app;
- how translation affected design decisions;
- how we overcame the main issues faced;
- and most importantly, what we'd do differently next time.

By the end of this talk, you will have a better understanding of how to
translate your Shiny app to help you to share your app with a much wider
audience.
