    computing and mathematical digital learning software. He holds a
    PhD in Applied Mathematics from Newcastle University, researching
    the physics of quantum fluids through high performance computer
    simulation. Until recently George worked as part of the E-learning
    Unit at Newcastle University, developing software, providing research
    support and teaching mathematical computing with R, Python, LaTeX and
    more. George is now lead developer for the webR project, aiming to
    compile R and its packages for WebAssembly.

<!-- ABSTRACT ----
Please write abstract below. You may use simple markdown (links, code style, bold, italics)
-->

In this talk I introduce webR, a port of R to WebAssembly using Emscripten.
WebR brings a full R environment to the browser, enabling R code execution,
numerical analysis, loading packages and more. No local or cloud-based R
servers are required as all computation is performed within the browser.
I give a brief overview of our build process for webR, describing the toolchain
and some of the issues we encountered. A publicly available web-based R session
is demonstrated, with package and plotting support.
