<!-- ABSTRACT ----
Please write abstract below. You may use simple markdown (links, code style, bold, italics)

Dealing with date-times is hard. Dealing with date-times without the proper
tooling is even harder! clock is an R package that aims to provide comprehensive
and safe handling of date-times. It goes beyond the date and date-time types
that base R provides, implementing new types for year-month, year-quarter, ISO
year-week, and many other date-like formats, all with up to nanosecond
precision. In this talk, you'll see how clock emphasizes "safety first" when
manipulating date-times, and how these new date-time types can be used in your
own work.
