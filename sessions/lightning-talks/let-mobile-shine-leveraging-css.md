<!-- ABSTRACT ----
Please write abstract below. You may use simple markdown (links, code style, bold, italics)
-->

As shiny developers, we spend a lot of time working on the server side, and
less time on the UI/UX part. According to the Engineering Production-Grade Shiny
Apps book by the ThinkR team, no matter how complex and innovative your back-
end is, your application is bad if your user experience (UX) is bad. People
spend more time on the internet from their mobile phones, so it is important to
ensure that our shiny apps are mobile responsive. At the beginning of this year,
I was tasked with creating a mobile version of an already made shiny app in the
shortest time possible. In this talk, as much as this work is tied to an NDA, I
will highlight a few css tricks that I used to achieve this.
