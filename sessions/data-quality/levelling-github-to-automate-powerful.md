<!-- ABSTRACT ----
Please write abstract below. You may use simple markdown (links, code style, bold, italics)
-->

If you've invested a lot of time and energy on a data science project, you might be 
ready to move on to new and exciting things. Don't let your old projects wither away
and die! There are some powerful and free resources from GitHub that you can leverage
to help pay it forward to the next person looking to use your work. 

In this talk, I'll showcase how you can transform ordinary R scripts into self-sufficient, 
robust projects by converting your code into a package, adding some GitHub Actions, and 
storing data into GitHub Releases. This will help your projects more useful - now and long 
after you've stopped working on the project!
