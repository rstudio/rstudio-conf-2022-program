<!-- ABSTRACT ----
Please write abstract below. You may use simple markdown (links, code style, bold, italics)

No matter the requirements of the project, data are rarely ready for analysis
without some intervention up front, often described as cleaning or tidying up
your data. Researchers and data professionals employ many tools to make their
data usable for their needs; but, there exist data that are so far beneath the
threshold for usefulness that they cannot be used responsibly for analysis or
decision-making, i.e. “bad data.” This talk proposes a framework for identifying
bad data, with examples from both academic and industry; identifies challenges
you might face from stakeholders when you identify bad data; and suggests
concrete steps you can take to overcome those challenges now and in the future.
