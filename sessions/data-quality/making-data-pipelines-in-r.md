When people first learn about R’s capabilities to create fully integrated
systems, automated visuals, and seamless data pipelines, the reaction can span
from disbelief to amazement. R’s expansive capabilities can leave some feeling
overwhelmed when tasked with larger projects like data pipelines. This talk
invites the participant to hear the perspective of a self-taught R user who used
curiosity and patience to create a functional data pipeline in R for a local
health department. Specifically, this talk will touch on the following topics:

-Surveying Data Landscapes -File Structures -Saving Yourself with Data
Validation -Modularizing Code -Connecting Scripts -Scaling for Dissemination
-Remaining Calm in Unfamiliar R Territories
