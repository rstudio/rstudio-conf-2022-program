<!-- ABSTRACT ----
Please write abstract below. You may use simple markdown (links, code style, bold, italics)
-->

Have you ever had so much fun building a data visualization that it felt like
a thrill ride? What if your dataviz actually WAS a thrill ride—a 3D virtual
reality rollercoaster through your dataset? In this talk, I’ll show you how
to create incredibly engaging and informative 3D visualizations in R, and
demonstrate what makes a good 3D dataviz. Using the rayrender package, you’ll
see how you can interactively fly through 3D scenes in real-time, without ever
leaving RStudio. Learn how you can use code to create 3D structures, plot data,
and even make generative art: visualizing everything from the smallest molecule
to the vast reaches of space, in only a few lines of code.
