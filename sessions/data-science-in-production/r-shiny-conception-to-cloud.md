<!-- ABSTRACT ----
Please write abstract below. You may use simple markdown (links, code style, bold, italics)

I will share how we published an R Shiny application to AWS, the decisions we
made, and what we learned in the process.

One challenge we faced was figuring out how we could develop collaboratively. We
needed to define our development workflow, including version control, dependency
management, and quality assurance.

Then, we needed to define the deployment method. R Studio is great for
development, but it may hide many of the aspects that break the application. We
used CI/CD workflows as much as possible to make sure our code was robust before
pushing the changes to production.

Lastly, our infrastructure team designed a framework that is replicable, so we
are ready to deploy new R Shiny applications quickly and focus on data analysis.
