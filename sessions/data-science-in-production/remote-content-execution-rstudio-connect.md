<!-- ABSTRACT ----
Please write abstract below. You may use simple markdown (links, code style, bold, italics)
-->

This summer the RStudio Connect team will announce a feature which has been over
two years in the making: “Remote” off-host content execution with launcher in
Kubernetes.

We have been quietly beta testing the Launcher feature with select partners and
customers for several months while we prepare for the public announcement.

This talk will highlight why someone might want to use this new execution
mode with Connect, show just how seamless it is to get everything configured
in a fresh environment on EKS, and finally set some critical context for what
publishers and administrators should expect by addressing the anticipated FAQs.
