  bio: |+
    I am a mission-driven problem solver with expertise in bringing data
    science applications from inception to profitability and acquisition.
    I build data and analytic tools that help users understand challenges,
    make informed decisions, and act. My experience across the data
    science value chain—ingestion, storage, processing, analytics, AI/
    ML, visualization, reporting, and client delivery—allows end-users
    to spend less time dealing with data and more time doing their jobs.
    As the first non-founder employee of 202 Group, I am responsible
    for our data and systems architecture strategy, implementation, and
    delivery. As a member of a small and fast-growing team, I also lead
    our recruiting efforts and human capital strategy. Please reach out
    if you are interested in learning more about how 202 Group is using
    technology to drive mission outcomes in supply chain risk management
    (SCRM) for our national security clients.

<!-- ABSTRACT ----
Please write abstract below. You may use simple markdown (links, code style, bold, italics)
-->

Benjy Braun, Chief Architect for 202 Group, shows how he and the 202 Group
team build customer facing applications and secure websites while focusing on
data science and not having to worry about hiring—or learning—a bunch of web
tools like JavaScript and php. With well organized git repos and Rmarkdown,
learn how to build websites for customers with embedded shiny apps and dynamic
visualizations; then publish and deploy them using RStudio-Connect. Using this
method, you won’t confine your analysis to static documents like PowerPoint
and pdfs and your customers will always see the latest and most up do date
information. The tools are out there to do this and it’s easy to start and
iterate with more features overtime.
