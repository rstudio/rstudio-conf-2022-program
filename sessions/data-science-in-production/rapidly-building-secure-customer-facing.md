  bio: |+
    I am a mission-driven problem solver with expertise in bringing data
    science applications from inception to profitability and acquisition.
    I build data and analytic tools that help users understand challenges,
    make informed decisions, and act. My experience across the data
    science value chain—ingestion, storage, processing, analytics, AI/
    ML, visualization, reporting, and client delivery—allows end-users
    to spend less time dealing with data and more time doing their jobs.
    My industry expertise is in the DoD/IC but I have interests in tech teams
    cultures, DEIB, and Biblical Hebrew.

<!-- ABSTRACT ----
Please write abstract below. You may use simple markdown (links, code style, bold, italics)
-->

Benjy Braun, Chief Architect for 202 Group, shows why he and the 202 Group
team decided to use RStudio Connect to build customer facing applications and secure websites while focusing on
data science and not having to worry about hiring for—or learning—a bunch of web
tools like JavaScript and php. With well organized git repos and Rmarkdown,
you can build websites for customers with embedded shiny apps and dynamic
visualizations and publish and deploy them using RStudio Connect. Using this
method, you won’t confine your analysis to static documents like PowerPoint
and pdfs and your customers will always see the latest and most up do date
information. The tools are out there to do this and it’s easy to start and
iterate with more features overtime.
