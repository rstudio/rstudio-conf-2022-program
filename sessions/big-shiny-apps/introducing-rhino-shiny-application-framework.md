<!-- ABSTRACT ----
Please write abstract below. You may use simple markdown (links, code style, bold, italics)
-->

R and Shiny are ready for production use in Enterprise. As Appsilon, we have
worked with tens of top global companies on their Shiny projects. Emphasis
on UI, monitoring users’ behavior, and solid engineering principles made the
difference. These are some of the practices that made projects impactful.
We want to help ourselves and the community to leverage best practices that
have worked for us so far. That’s why we built Rhino - the new framework for
Shiny in Enterprise. Kamil Żyła is a senior software engineer at Appsilon and
Rhino’s creator. He will share our experiences in ensuring the success of Shiny
projects. You will see why you may want to try Rhino in your next (or current)
project!
