<!-- ABSTRACT ----
Please write abstract below. You may use simple markdown (links, code style, bold, italics)
-->

Are you curious about Quarto? Maybe you saw it on Twitter or the RStudio::conf
agenda. Perhaps this raised questions like: What exactly is Quarto? What about
RMarkdown? (don’t worry it’s not going away!) What features does Quarto add?
What should I do with my existing Rmd/ipynb files?

This talk will answer all of those questions and more! I’ll present Quarto as
a next-gen version of RMarkdown, compare the similarities, and then discuss the
new features in Quarto for publishing documents, presentations, blog posts, lab
notebooks and more! Lastly, I’ll cover what this means for our customers using
RStudio Team, and the exciting new world for Python users.
