<!-- ABSTRACT ----
Please write abstract below. You may use simple markdown (links, code style, bold, italics)
-->

GitHub Actions (GHA) allows us to automate several tasks in R. In this
presentation, I will talk about my experience with GitHub Actions in the context
of R programming. I will show some examples of R projects where I use GitHub
Actions to automate several tasks, such as: checking and testing R packages,
update RMarkdown reports, update data and deploy a Shiny App, do Web Scraping,
and so on. After showing this examples, I will talk a bit about how we can use
the package usethis and the r-lib/actions GitHub repository to start automating
tasks in R projects and packages.
