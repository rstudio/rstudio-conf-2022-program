<!-- ABSTRACT ----
Please write abstract below. You may use simple markdown (links, code style, bold, italics)
-->

Slack is a useful communication tool for communities and businesses. Integrating
it with Shiny can make it even more useful. I'll show how my {shinyslack}
package allows for connections between Shiny apps and Slack teams. I’ll show
how users can wrap their existing Shiny UIs to quickly and easily add Slack
authentication to their Shiny apps. I'll also demonstrate how we’ve used
{shinyslack} to manage and streamline the R4DS Online Learning Community, and
how other R users might make the most of their Slack workspaces.
