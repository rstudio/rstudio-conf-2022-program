<!-- ABSTRACT ----
Please write abstract below. You may use simple markdown (links, code style, bold, italics)

Interactive maps are indispensable tools when we explore spatial datasets due
to their real-world context and intuitiveness. For a comprehensive understanding
of the data, it is often necessary to switch between several map layers (such as
states and counties). In this talk, I will show how to use the leafdown package
to quickly create interactive multi-layer maps in Shiny apps with just a few
lines of code.
