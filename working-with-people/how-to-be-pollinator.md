<!-- ABSTRACT ----
Please write abstract below. You may use simple markdown (links, code style, bold, italics)
-->

R users are part of data ecosystems comprising both statistical and non-
statistical applications. We may work with SAS or Stata datafiles; non-R users
may help run R scripts; or we may need to generate outputs in Word or Excel.
Just as pollinators support biodiversity, we believe R users can be constructive
members of diverse data ecosystems. Our talk will: (1) outline what it means to
be constructive, (2) highlight tools that can help R users contribute to their
ecosystems, and (3) describe practices that can improve workflows involving
diverse groups of staff and software. We hope our talk will inspire R users
to think creatively and empathetically about how R can be a force for good in
diverse data ecosystems.
