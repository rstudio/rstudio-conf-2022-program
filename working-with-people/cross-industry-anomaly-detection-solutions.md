<!-- ABSTRACT ----
Please write abstract below. You may use simple markdown (links, code style, bold, italics)

This session highlights two anomaly detection use cases in production:
identification of problematic life sciences manufacturing units and
identification of significant newsworthy events. With both solutions, Shiny is
integrated with live data to provide early detection for proactive intervention.
Shinyâ€™s intuitive user interface also allows for interaction with the data
behind anomalies to uncover potential causes and paths to action or resolution.

The session also briefly highlights a rapid prototyping development approach
with Shiny. This technique allows for collaborative refinement of the underlying
anomaly detection model in R, quickly incorporating user feedback, where end
users may not have in-depth machine learning knowledge.
